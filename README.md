# Task Manager Application - Step 6

## Redis Caching Implementation

This step adds caching functionality to improve application performance.

### Implemented Features

- Redis integration for caching
- Spring Cache abstraction
- Cached task retrieval operations
- Cache timeouts for data freshness

### Caching Strategy

- Cache task retrievals by ID and user
- Cache notifications by user
- Search cache first, then database if not found
- Time-based expiration for cache entries

### Technical Implementation

- Spring Cache annotations (@Cacheable, @CacheEvict)
- Redis configuration in application.properties
- Cache manager configuration in a dedicated config class
- Cache key generation strategy

### Performance Benefits

- Reduced database load for frequent queries
- Faster response times for cached data
- Intelligent cache invalidation on updates
- Scalable caching solution for future growth

### Next Steps

Proceed to branch `step6` for Step 7 (RabbitMQ Messaging)
