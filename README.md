# Task Manager Application - Step 8

## Scheduling & Async Tasks

This final step adds scheduled jobs and asynchronous processing for improved application functionality.

### Implemented Features

- Scheduled task for checking overdue tasks
- Asynchronous processing for background operations
- Email notification for overdue tasks
- Performance optimization for long-running operations

### Scheduling Implementation

- @Scheduled annotation for periodic tasks
- Cron expressions for flexible scheduling
- Configurable schedule through application properties
- Scheduled task to check and mark overdue tasks

### Asynchronous Processing

- @Async annotation for background operations
- Thread pool configuration for async tasks
- CompletableFuture for handling async results
- Async error handling strategies

### Technical Benefits

- Reduced response times by offloading work to background threads
- Automatic monitoring of task deadlines
- Improved user experience with timely notifications
- Better resource utilization

### Project Completion

This step completes the Task Manager application with all planned features:
- REST API with proper controllers and services
- Database persistence with PostgreSQL
- Containerization with Docker
- Caching with Redis
- Messaging with RabbitMQ
- Scheduled and asynchronous operations
