# Task Manager Application - Step 7

## RabbitMQ Messaging Integration

This step implements asynchronous messaging to decouple components of the application.

### Implemented Features

- RabbitMQ integration for messaging
- Event-driven notification system
- Asynchronous task processing
- Notification service refactored to use messaging

### Message-Based Architecture

- Task service publishes events when tasks are created/updated
- Notification service subscribes to task events
- Notifications are created asynchronously
- Decoupled services for better scalability

### Technical Implementation

- Spring AMQP for RabbitMQ integration
- Queue, exchange, and binding configuration
- Message converters for serialization/deserialization
- Error handling for message processing

### Benefits

- Decoupled components with clear boundaries
- Better scalability for individual services
- Improved fault tolerance
- Asynchronous processing for better performance

### Next Steps

Proceed to branch `step7` for Step 8 (Scheduling & Async Tasks)
