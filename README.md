# Task Manager Application - Step 2

## Unit Testing

This step focuses on adding unit tests to ensure the reliability of the application.

### Implemented Features

- Unit tests for all service classes
- Unit tests for all controller endpoints
- Test coverage for basic functionality

### Testing Tools Used

- JUnit 5 for test execution
- Spring Boot Test for integration testing
- MockMvc for testing controllers
- Assertions for validating results

### Testing Approach

- Test all service methods for correct business logic
- Test all controller endpoints for proper HTTP responses
- Verify proper data transformation and validation
- Test both positive scenarios and edge cases

### Project Structure

- Tests mirror the application package structure
- Separate test classes for each service and controller
- Mock implementations of services for testing controllers

### Next Steps
